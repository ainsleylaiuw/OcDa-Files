# OcDa-Files
Repo to hold files for my work with the [Ocean Data Lab](https://sites.uw.edu/abadi/)


## NB_x
Majority of work done by me will be in Jupyter Notebooks titled 'NB_x.ipynb'.

### NB_1
This notebook includes inital work done by me in my early months of being part of the lab. Lots of plotting. Worked on familiarizing myself with the usage of MSEED/PSD pickle files. Also adapted SPDF plotting code found in (https://github.com/Ocean-Data-Lab/Website-backend/blob/master/SpecGraph/SPDF.py) to be used for my own purposes. Has later work on transmission/receive/source level which is refactored into NB_2 and 3. Also started work on Cepstrum Plotting in this.

#### Cepstrum.ipynb


#### Histograms_by_type.ipynb
Notebook to plot histograms by speed or distance to see distribution. Back then, used Khirod's (former lab member) dataset which might have had differences in what features were named/included. File is defunct, basically, since it uses outdated dataset.
